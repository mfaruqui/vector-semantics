This code repository contains the code for generating log-bilinear
word embeddings using noise contrastive estimation as explained in
(Mnih and Kavukcuoglu, NIPS 2013). 

The code can run on multiple cores using openmp (C++). The speedup
with using multiple cores is a little less than linear. For example
using 6 cores can give up 3-4 times speedup.

Run time options need to be changed in the main() function as of now.

Use the following command to compile the program:-

g++ -std=c++11 -fopenmp -I eigen-eigen-ffa86ffb5570/ train.cc -o train
./train
