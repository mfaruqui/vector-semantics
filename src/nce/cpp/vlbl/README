This code repository contains the code for generating log-bilinear
word embeddings using noise contrastive estimation as explained in
(Mnih and Kavukcuoglu, NIPS 2013). The objective function however
is not the same and has been changed. See the report for more details.

Use the following commands to compile and run the program:-

0) If you want to use single core, remove -fopenmp from the below command
1) g++ -std=c++11 -fopenmp -I eigen-eigen-ffa86ffb5570/ train.cc utils.cc logadd.cc -o train
2) ./train

Following are the role of different files:

1. train.cc -- generate simple embeddings using word co-occurrences

2. train-prior.cc -- generate word embeddings using an exponential prior based on euclidean distance.
The prior gets updated after a number of words have been seen. This parameter is to be given by the user
along with the weight given to the euclidean distance in the prior.

3. train-prior-grad-zero.cc -- the prior of a graph based similarity measure between words in the paraphrase
databse is set to zero and the vector is updated according to that after a number of words have been seen. This
will be documented in a report soon.
